# Humana-Healthcare

This project looks at healthcare data fro m the HUMANA insurance company. I explore trends from Florida customer during March 2023. Using Power Query, I transformed the data to make it more useful. 

I created a new column to combine county name and state as one string. To find the percentage of people who have Humana in each of the counties, I created another custom formula dividing COUNT by MMA TOTAL, to get overall market share.
